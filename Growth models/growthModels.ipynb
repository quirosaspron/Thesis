    "Simply put, a growth function describes the relationship between some variable — such as time or population — and the growth of a quantity. For example, it can model time versus return on investment, time versus population, or the growth of healthy versus cancerous cells.\n",
    "\n",
    "Growth functions can often be modeled through differential equations, and there are many types of them. Because different systems behave and evolve in distinct ways, we need a variety of equations to describe these processes accurately.\n",
    "\n",
    "In what follows, I’ll explain some of the most commonly used growth models — how they are defined, when they are applied, and what their characteristic shapes look like.\n",
    "\n",
    "Growth models are particularly interesting because they provide powerful tools to describe how something increases over time — whether it’s populations, technologies, investments, companies, or even diseases."

    "So while the Logistic Model has a quadratic breaking mehcanism ($-Y^2$), the Gompertz has a Logarithmic breaking mechanism $-Y \\ln Y$. Due to this we get a differetn point of maximum growth, in the Logistic it is achived at **50%** of $K$, but in Gompertz it's at  **36.8%** ($1/e$) of $K$. The qualitative difference is that there is an asymetry in the Gompertz shown as an early peak, where we reach the a maximum point early and then we spend a long time slowly decelerating. Whereas in the Logistic it's more symetric, we slow down at the same rate as we  sped up. \n",

    "$p Y^a$ is the rate at which the organism assimilates nutrients and oxygen to create new cells, proteins, and structures. And $q Y^b$ is the rate at which the organism burns existing tissue or energy just to maintain itself (cellular respiration, heat loss, repairing damage).\n",
    "\n",
    "The intresting thing about this is that $Y^a$ is limited by surface area. Nutrients and oxygen must pass through surfaces (intestines, gills, lungs, cell membranes), so it scales with surface area. When we have growth in a geometric object where the shape is constant, the surface of the object grows slower than the volume, to the power of $\\approx 2/3$. So $a \\approx 2/3$\n",
    "##### Geometric Proof (Cube)\n",
    "\n",
    "Let $L$ be the side length of a cube, $V$ the volume and $S$ the surface. \n",
    "$$V = L^3 \\implies L = V^{1/3}$$\n",
    "$$S = 6L^2$$\n",
    "Substitute $L$ into the $S$ equation:\n",
    "$$S = 6(V^{1/3})^2$$\n",
    "**Result:**\n",
    "$$S = 6 V^{2/3}$$\n",
    "**Conclusion:** Surface Area is proportional to Volume raised to the power of **2/3**.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "But $Y^b$ scales with Volume/Mass. Every single cell in the body needs energy to stay alive. Therefore, the \"maintenance\" cost scales with the total volume/weight (We treat volume as weight because most organism are can be thought of as basically \"bags of water\" the tissue density is about 1g/cm^3 and the density of the water is also 1g/cm^3. Basically the same. so weight is density times volume, if density is roughly 1g/cm^3 then we have weight (g)= 1g/cm^3 * volume(cm^3), so we get weight = volume.). Because cells occupy the entire volume of the body, this expenditure scales linealy with our total mass. So $b \\approx 1$. \n",
    "\n",
    "So our model is telling us that whena organisms are small they have a lot of surface relative to their weight. This means they have a lot of income (production of tissue) and little expenditure (cost of energy). This makes them grow fast early on. But as they grow, the geometric reality pill starts to catch up. Our volume grows cubically while the surface grows cuadratically. Inevitably we will get to a point were our income = expenditure. That is when we will reach our maximum size. \n",
    "\n",
    "So according to this geometric reassoning, theory says: $a$ should be about $2/3$ ($0.67$). Although this depends on the assumption that the shape of the organism that is growing stays constant, which doesn't sound that realistic. Animals aren't perfect spheres. But actually this geometric constraint is not just theoretical. A recent study detailed in Quanta Magazine regarding shark growth confirms this model (see references at the end). It found that despite biological complexity, massive species scale strictly adhering to the \"square-cube law\" predicted by this equation.\n"

    "## Afterthoughts\n",
    "\n",
    "The equations we’ve been studying here, the Gompertz, Logistic, Richards, Von Bertalanffy, Morgan, etc.  \n",
    "Are essentially **sigmoid or asymptotic growth models**.  \n",
    "Their essential idea is:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Growth rate depends on the current value relative to a limit**\n",
    "\n",
    "This is not specific to biology. It appears in technology, AI, economics, and social sciences, for example in AI:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **GPU/compute performance over time**: e.g., Moore’s law, where performance saturates due to physical limits.  \n",
    "- **Data size vs. model performance**: accuracy often follows a logistic or power-law curve as you increase training data.  \n",
    "- **Parameter growth in neural networks**: number of parameters vs. performance often shows diminishing returns, which is sigmoid-like.  \n",
    "- **Benchmarks and efficiency**: energy consumption, inference time, or throughput can saturate asymptotically.  \n",
    "\n",
    "In finance, growth models like Gompertz or logistic curves can describe processes with diminishing returns or saturation, such as:  \n",
    "\n",
    "- Portfolio growth under risk constraints  \n",
    "- Adoption of new financial products  \n",
    "- Revenue and market penetration of companies  \n",
    "\n",
    "They capture how gains accelerate initially but slow as limits like capital, market size, or risk are approached.\n",
    "\n",
    "In electronic warfare (EW), many processes exhibit asymptotic or saturating behavior that growth models can capture:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Signal jamming effectiveness vs. power or resources**: initially, increasing jamming power rapidly degrades enemy signals, but additional power has diminishing returns, which is sigmoid-like.  \n",
    "- **Sensor detection probability vs. observation time**: the chance of detecting a target often grows quickly at first and then approaches a maximum limit.  \n",
    "- **Network or spectrum saturation**: interference and countermeasure effectiveness may plateau as the environment reaches maximum congestion.\n",
    "\n",
    "In biotech, these growth models are directly relevant because many biological and technological processes show asymptotic, sigmoid, or saturating behavior:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Cell or microbial culture growth**: logistic, Gompertz, or Richards models describe how populations expand and plateau due to nutrient limits.  \n",
    "- **Protein expression or enzyme activity**: increasing substrate or inducer concentration often shows diminishing returns, fitting a sigmoidal curve.  \n",
    "- **Drug response / dose–response curves**: the effect of a drug on cells or organisms often rises quickly at low doses and saturates at high doses.  \n",
    "- **Bioprocess optimization**: scaling up bioreactors, optimizing yield, or predicting saturation points for resource use can be modeled using these equations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Fundamentally, these growth models are **white-box tools**: they make explicit assumptions about how a system evolves, with parameters that have clear interpretations (e.g., maximum value, growth rate, shape). This allows us to understand and reason about the system, not just make predictions based on past data blindly like a black-box model would.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Using these models provides a **white-box framework** to predict system behavior, allocate resources efficiently, and identify points of diminishing returns, which is critical in planning and optimization.\n"
