    "Simply put, a growth function describes the relationship between some variable — such as time or population — and the growth of a quantity. For example, it can model time versus return on investment, time versus population, or the growth of healthy versus cancerous cells.\n",
    "\n",
    "Growth functions can often be modeled through differential equations, and there are many types of them. Because different systems behave and evolve in distinct ways, we need a variety of equations to describe these processes accurately.\n",
    "\n",
    "In what follows, I’ll explain some of the most commonly used growth models — how they are defined, when they are applied, and what their characteristic shapes look like.\n",
    "\n",
    "Growth models are particularly interesting because they provide powerful tools to describe how something increases over time — whether it’s populations, technologies, investments, companies, or even diseases."

    "## Afterthoughts\n",
    "\n",
    "The equations we’ve been studying here, the Gompertz, Logistic, Richards, Von Bertalanffy, Morgan, etc.  \n",
    "Are essentially **sigmoid or asymptotic growth models**.  \n",
    "Their essential idea is:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Growth rate depends on the current value relative to a limit**\n",
    "\n",
    "This is not specific to biology. It appears in technology, AI, economics, and social sciences, for example in AI:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **GPU/compute performance over time**: e.g., Moore’s law, where performance saturates due to physical limits.  \n",
    "- **Data size vs. model performance**: accuracy often follows a logistic or power-law curve as you increase training data.  \n",
    "- **Parameter growth in neural networks**: number of parameters vs. performance often shows diminishing returns, which is sigmoid-like.  \n",
    "- **Benchmarks and efficiency**: energy consumption, inference time, or throughput can saturate asymptotically.  \n",
    "\n",
    "In finance, growth models like Gompertz or logistic curves can describe processes with diminishing returns or saturation, such as:  \n",
    "\n",
    "- Portfolio growth under risk constraints  \n",
    "- Adoption of new financial products  \n",
    "- Revenue and market penetration of companies  \n",
    "\n",
    "They capture how gains accelerate initially but slow as limits like capital, market size, or risk are approached.\n",
    "\n",
    "In electronic warfare (EW), many processes exhibit asymptotic or saturating behavior that growth models can capture:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Signal jamming effectiveness vs. power or resources**: initially, increasing jamming power rapidly degrades enemy signals, but additional power has diminishing returns, which is sigmoid-like.  \n",
    "- **Sensor detection probability vs. observation time**: the chance of detecting a target often grows quickly at first and then approaches a maximum limit.  \n",
    "- **Network or spectrum saturation**: interference and countermeasure effectiveness may plateau as the environment reaches maximum congestion.\n",
    "\n",
    "In biotech, these growth models are directly relevant because many biological and technological processes show asymptotic, sigmoid, or saturating behavior:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Cell or microbial culture growth**: logistic, Gompertz, or Richards models describe how populations expand and plateau due to nutrient limits.  \n",
    "- **Protein expression or enzyme activity**: increasing substrate or inducer concentration often shows diminishing returns, fitting a sigmoidal curve.  \n",
    "- **Drug response / dose–response curves**: the effect of a drug on cells or organisms often rises quickly at low doses and saturates at high doses.  \n",
    "- **Bioprocess optimization**: scaling up bioreactors, optimizing yield, or predicting saturation points for resource use can be modeled using these equations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Fundamentally, these growth models are **white-box tools**: they make explicit assumptions about how a system evolves, with parameters that have clear interpretations (e.g., maximum value, growth rate, shape). This allows us to understand and reason about the system, not just make predictions based on past data blindly like a black-box model would.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Using these models provides a **white-box framework** to predict system behavior, allocate resources efficiently, and identify points of diminishing returns, which is critical in planning and optimization.\n"
